# Work

# TODO
* review RK45 formula and maybe it is a way to stabilize the issue high values for delta z / delta t when t is small
* apply TT-ALS for a simpler problem ( diabetes regression with TT-ALS optimizaiton) , maybe better
implemented at optimize phase not backward??
need to know, will it converege ?
* experiment regularization over trajectory itself , i.e sum of z norm


# In progress
* experiment RLS applied to linear ODE problem whey LS is applied to matrix. Test the Recursive part
* Apply Euler integ. for forward. why ? Formula is easier => didn't converge also



# Done
